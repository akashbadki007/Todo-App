## Todo-App

### Project Overview
The Todo-App is a full-stack web application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. Developed using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Postman for API testing, the app allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks seamlessly.

### Objectives
- **Task Management:** To provide a robust platform for users to manage their to-do lists.
- **CRUD Operations:** To enable users to perform create, read, update, and delete operations on tasks.
- **API Integration:** To demonstrate the use of APIs for backend operations.

### Technologies Used
- **Node.js:** For building the server-side logic.
- **Express:** For handling HTTP requests and middleware.
- **MongoDB:** For storing task data.
- **Compass:** For MongoDB database visualization.
- **Postman:** For API testing and development.

### Key Features
- **Task Creation:** Allows users to add new tasks.
- **Task Display:** Lists all tasks stored in the database.
- **Task Update:** Enables users to edit existing tasks.
- **Task Deletion:** Allows users to remove tasks.
- **API Integration:** Uses RESTful APIs for all backend operations.

### Challenges Faced
- **Database Integration:** Ensuring seamless interaction between the application and MongoDB.
- **API Development:** Creating robust and secure APIs for task management.
- **User Experience:** Designing a user-friendly interface for efficient task management.

### Conclusion
The Todo-App project showcases my ability to develop a full-stack web application using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Through this project, I have demonstrated proficiency in backend development, database management, and API integration, along with a commitment to creating functional and user-centric applications.
